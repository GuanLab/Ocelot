Download required data and pre-process them in the ../data_challenge folder. Then follow the steps in "bash.sh".
Reproducing all these imputations and evaluations requires considerable time (>2 months) even with super computing resources, we therefore also provide the processed data, trained models and predictions together with the reproducible scripts.
